Guide on generally setting up hardware and necessary software to get a RB3 Fender Mustang to operate in Rocksmith 2014 Remastered

## The blog post, skip ahead

To keep it short, the idea to use a RB3 Mustang in Rocksmith 2014 Remastered came around when I was reintroduced to Rocksmith and modding it when a user on Reddit by {insert username here} posted how to use a software based "drop tune" effect to emulate the effect of some handy, albeit extremely expensive hardware that a company called Digitec makes. I enjoyed it, and I wanted to take it farther and push the limits.

## Dependancies and Hardware

Presented in no particular order because reasons.

- PC or MacOS with Rocksmith 2014 Remastered **NOTE** <em>MacOS is currently untested and is theoretically possible. Guide only focuses on Windows because that's what I have on hand</em>

- Male to Male 5 Pin DIN MIDI cable of an acceptable length for your needs
- An audio interface that can accept MIDI through a 5 Pin DIN or a dedicated MIDI interface that can accept a 5 Pin DIN
